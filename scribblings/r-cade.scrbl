              [#:title window-title string? "R-cade"])
         void?]{
Creates a new game window, video memory, and enters the main game loop.

The @racket[game-loop] parameter is a function you provide, which will be called once per frame and should take no arguments.

The @racket[width] and @racket[height] parameters define the size of video memory (not the size of the window!).

The @racket[init] procedure - if provided - is called before the @racket[game-loop] starts. If you have initialization or setup code that requires R-cade state be initialized, this is where you can safely do it.

The @racket[scale-factor] parameter will determine the initial size of the window. The default will let auto pick a scale factor that is appropriate given the size of the display.

The @racket[frame-rate] is the number of times per second the @racket[game-loop] function will be called the window will update with what's stored in VRAM.

The @racket[crt-effect] controls whether or not the contents of VRAM are rendered using a fullscreen shader effect that mimics a CRT. If this is set to @racket[#f] the effect will be disabled.

The @racket[window-title] parameter is the title given to the window created.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(quit) void?]{Closes the window, which will terminate the main game loop.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(goto [game-loop procedure?]) void?]{Changes the game loop function to @racket[game-loop]. This doesn't take affect until the next frame. This function is used to change between various game states. For example, you might have a @tt{start-screen} game state, a @tt{main-game} state, and a @tt{pause-game} state that are switched between.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(wait [until procedure? btn-any]) void?]{Hard stops the game loop and waits until either the window is closed or the until function returns true. While waiting, events are still processed.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(sync) void?]{Called once per frame automatically by the main game loop. You shouldn’t need to call this yourself unless you are creating your own game loop. It processes all events, renders video memory, and ensures the framerate is locked.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(frame) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{Returns the current frame: 1, 2, 3, ...}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(frametime) real?]{Returns the delta time (in seconds) since the last frame. It’s best to use this when applying any kind of velocity to a game object instead of assuming the framerate will be constant.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(gametime) real?]{Returns the total time (in seconds) since the game started.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(width) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{Returns the width of VRAM in pixels. This is the same value that was passed to the @racket[run] function.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(height) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{Returns the height of VRAM in pixels. This is the same value that was passed to the @racket[run] function.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@section{Input}


All @tt{btn-*} functions return @racket[#f] if their respective button is not pressed, otherwise they return the count of how many frames the button has been pressed for. For example, a return value of @tt{1} would indicate the button was just pressed. This allows for easy testing of not pressed, pressed, just pressed, or against a desired repeat rate.


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(btn-start) (or #f exact-nonnegative-integer?)]{Returns the state of the ENTER key.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(btn-select) (or #f exact-nonnegative-integer?)]{Returns the state of the SPACEBAR key.}

@defproc[(btn-mouse) (or #f exact-nonnegative-integer?)]{Returns the state of the LEFT mouse button.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(btn-any) boolean?]{Returns the equivelant of:
 @racketblock[(or (btn-start)
                  (btn-select)

                  (btn-z)
                  (btn-x))]}

This function isn't really used much outside of @racket[wait].


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(mouse-x) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{Returns the X pixel (in VRAM) that the mouse is over. @tt{0} is the left edge.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(mouse-y) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{Returns the Y pixel (in VRAM) that the mouse is over. @tt{0} is the top edge.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(hide-mouse) void?]{Hides the mouse cursor while over the window.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(show-mouse) void?]{Shows the mouse cursor while over the window.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@section{Action Bindings}

Sometimes you want to be able to bind buttons to specific, named actions so your
code is easier to read (and modify if you want to change your button mapping). To
do this, use the @racket[define-action] macro.


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defform/subs[(define-action name btn [rate #f])
              ([name symbol?]
               [btn procedure?]
               [rate (or #t exact-nonnegative-integer?)])]{
Defines a new function @racket[name] that returns @racket[#t] if the mapped @racket[btn] binding predicate function should be considered "pressed".

If @racket[rate] is @racket[#f] (the default), then the action is defined as @racket[(define name btn)].

If @racket[rate] is @racket[#t] then the action will return @racket[#t] if the @racket[btn] returns @tt{1}, indicating it was just pressed this frame.

Otherwise, @racket[rate] should be a non-negative integer indicating how many times per seconds the action function should return @racket[#t] assuming the button is held down. This is useful for actions like shooting that shouldn't happen every frame, but you also don't want the user to have to keep pressing the input button.

@racketblock[
 (define-action move-left btn-left)
 (define-action jump btn-z #t)
 (define-action fire btn-x 5)
]}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@section{Drawing}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(cls [c exact-nonnegative-integer? 0]) void?]{Clears video memory with the specified color. Remember that video memory isn’t magically wiped each frame.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(color [c exact-nonnegative-integer?]) void?]{Changes the active color to @racket[c] (0-15). The default color palette is the same as the PICO-8:

 @image["scribblings/palette.png"]}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(set-color! [c exact-nonnegative-integer?]
                     [r byte?]
                     [g byte?]
                     [b byte?]) void?]{
Changes the color in the palette at index @racket[c] to the RGB byte values specified by @racket[r], @racket[g], and @racket[b].}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(draw [x real?] [y real?] [sprite (listof byte?)]) void?]{
Uses the current color to render a 1-bit sprite composed of bytes to VRAM at (@racket[x],@racket[y]). For example:

@code[]{(draw 10 12 '(#b01000000 #b11100000 #b01000000))}

The above would draw a 3x3 sprite that looks like a + sign to the pixels at (10,12) -> (12,14). Any bit set in the sprite pattern will change the pixel color in VRAM to the current color. Any cleared bits are skipped.

@italic{Remember! The most significant bit of each byte is drawn at @racket[x]. This is important, because if you'd like to draw a single pixel at (@racket[x],@racket[y]), you need to draw @tt{#b10000000} and not @tt{#b00000001}!}
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(draw-ex [x real?] [y real?] [sprite (listof integer?)]) void?]{
This is exactly the same as @racket[draw], except that the sprite is considered to be 16-bits wide. The most significant byte of each scanline is rendered first, followed by the least significant byte.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(text [x real?] [y real?] [s any]) void?]{Draw the value @racket[s] at (@racket[x],@racket[y]) using the current font. The default font is a fixed-width, ASCII font with character range [@tt{#x20},@tt{#x7f}]. Each character is 3x6 pixels in size.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(line [x1 real?] [y1 real?] [x2 real?] [y2 real?]) void?]{Draw a line from (@racket[x1],@racket[y1]) to (@racket[x2],@racket[y2]) using the current color.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(rect [x real?]
               [y real?]
               [w real?]
               [h real?]
               [#:fill boolean? #f])
         void?]{
Draw a rectangle starting at (@racket[x],@racket[y]) with a width @racket[w] and height @racket[h] using the current color. If @racket[fill] is @racket[#t] then it will be a solid rectangle, otherwise just the outline.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(circle [x real?] [y real?] [r real?] [#:fill boolean? #f]) void?]{
Draw a circle with its center at (@racket[x],@racket[y]) and radius @racket[r] using the current color. If @racket[fill] is @racket[#t] then it will be solid, otherwise just the outline.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@section{Fonts}

There are three built-in fonts and it's possible to create your own and use them as well.


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(make-font [sprites (vectorof (listof byte?))]
                    [#:advance width exact-nonnegative-integer? 8]
                    [#:base base exact-nonnegative-integer? 33]) font?]{
Define a new font that can be set with the @racket[font] function and rendered with @racket[text].

The @racket[width] parameter is the pixel width of each character sprite. The @racket[base] parameter is the ordinal value of the first ASCII character in the font (typically this is @racket[33], the @racket[#\!] character). Any character drawn that isn't in the font is drawn as a space.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(font [font font?]) void?]{
Sets the current @racket[font] to draw characters with when using the @racket[text] function.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(font-sprite [char char?]) (or/c (listof byte?) #f)]{
Returns the sprite in the current @racket[font] for @racket[char] or @racket[#f] if no sprite exists for it.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(font-advance) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{
Returns the cursor x advance value in pixels for the current @racket[font]. This is always the width of the font plus 1 pixel.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(font-height) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{
Returns the line height in pixels for the current @racket[font]. The line height is always the number of scanlines of the first character sprite in the font plus 1 pixel.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defthing[basic-font font?]{
The default font of 3x6 character sprites.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defthing[tall-font font?]{
A font of 5x8 character sprites.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defthing[wide-font font?]{
A font of 7x8 character sprites.
}



@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@section{Voices}

All sounds (and music) are played using voices. A voice is both an "instrument" (wave function) and an "envelope" (volume function).


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(voice [instrument procedure?] [envelope procedure?]) voice?]{

The @racket[instrument] function is like @racket[sin] or @racket[cos]. It is given a value in the range of @tt{[0.0, 2pi]} and returns a value in the range of @tt{[-1.0, 1.0]}. Aside from any built-in Racket functions (e.g. @racket[sin] and @racket[cos]) there are 4 other pre-defined wave functions you can use:

@itemlist[
 @item{@racket[sawtooth-wave]}
 @item{@racket[square-wave]}
 @item{@racket[triangle-wave]}
 @item{@racket[noise-wave]}
]

Additionally, you can create your own wave functions (instruments) with the @racket[synth] macro.

The @racket[envelope] function is used to set the volume of a sound over the duration of it. The @racket[envelope] function is given a single value in the range [@tt{0.0}, @tt{1.0}] indicating where in the sound it is. It should return a value in the range [@tt{0.0}, @tt{1.0}], where @tt{0.0} indicates a null amplitude and @tt{1.0} indicates full amplitude. Some pre-defined envelopes include:

@itemlist[
 @item{@racket[basic-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[fade-in-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[fade-out-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[z-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[s-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[peak-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[trough-envelope]}
 @item{@racket[adsr-envelope]}
]

There is also an @racket[envelope] function that helps with the creation of your own envelopes.
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(voice? [x any]) boolean?]{Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[x] is a valid @racket[voice] object.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defthing[basic-voice voice? #:value (voice sin basic-envelope)]{The default @racket[voice] used to create sounds.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defform/subs[(synth (wave-function q) ...)
              ([wave-function procedure?]
               [q real?])]{
Creates a lambda function that is the combination of multiple @racket[wave-function]s at frequency harmonics, each muliplied by @racket[q].

Each @racket[wave-function] can be any function valid as the instrument of a @racket[voice]. Most common would be @racket[sin] and @racket[cos]. For each @racket[wave-function] there should also be a corresponding @racket[q] argument that is how much that wave function will be multiplied by.

The wave functions are passed the frequency harmonic of the sound they are used for in the order they are provided to the @racket[synth] macro. For example, if the sound is playing a solid tone of 440 Hz, then the first wave function will be at 440 Hz, the second wave function at 880 Hz, the third at 1320 Hz, etc.

For example:

@racketblock[
 (synth (sin  1.0)     ; sin(x)     *  1.0
        (cos  0.3)     ; cos(x * 2) *  0.3
        (sin  0.1)     ; sin(x * 3) *  0.1
        (cos -0.3))    ; cos(x * 4) * -0.3
]

The above would be equivelant to the following wave function:

@racketblock[
 (λ (x)
   (+ (* (sin x) 1.0)
      (* (cos (* x 2)) 0.3)
      (* (sin (* x 3)) 0.1)
      (* (cos (* x 4)) -0.3)))
]

The function returned takes the x argument, applies it to each of the harmonics and returns the sum of them.

A simple online tool for playing with harmonic sound functions can be found at @url{https://meettechniek.info/additional/additive-synthesis.html}.

@italic{TIP: Instead of just the generic sine and cosine functions, trying sythenizing with some other wave functions like triangle-wave and noise-wave!}
}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(envelope [y real?] ...) procedure?]{Returns a function that can be used as the @racket[#:envelope] paramater to the @racket[sound] function. It builds a simple, evenly spaced, linearly interpolated plot of amplitude envelopes. For example, the @racket[z-envelope] is defined as:

@racketblock[(define z-envelope (envelope 1 1 0 0))]

This means that in the time range of [@tt{0.0}, @racket[0.33]] the sound will play at full amplitude. From [@racket[0.33], @racket[0.66]] the envelope will decay the amplitude linearly from @tt{1.0} down to @tt{0.0}. Finally, from [@racket[0.66], @tt{1.0}] the amplitude of the sound will be forced to @tt{0.0}.

@section{Sound}

All audio is played by composing 16-bit PCM WAV data using a @racket[voice]. Audio data that can be played is created using the @racket[sound] and @racket[music] functions.


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(sound [curve procedure?]

                [voice voice? basic-voice]) sound?]{
All sounds are made using the sound function. The @racket[curve] argument is a function that is given a single value in the range of [@tt{0.0}, @tt{1.0}] and should return a frequency to play at that time; @tt{0.0} is the beginning of the waveform and @tt{1.0} is the end. The seconds parameter defines the length of the waveform.

The @racket[voice] is used to define the wave function and volume envelope used when generating the PCM data for this sound. It is optional, and the default voice is just a simple @racket[sin] wave and the @racket[basic-envelope].

}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(stop-sound) void?]{Stops all sounds currently playing and clears the sound queue.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(sound-volume [vol real?]) void?]{Sets the volume of all sounds played. @racket[0.0] is muted and @racket[100.0] is full volume.}


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@section{Music}

Music is created by parsing notes and creating an individual waveform for each note, then combining them together into a single waveform to be played on a dedicated music channel. Only one "tune" can be playing at a time.


@;; ----------------------------------------------------
@defproc[(music [notes string?]
                [#:tempo beats-per-minute exact-nonnegative-integer? 160]
                [#:voice voice? basic-note]) music?]{
Parses the @racket[notes] string and builds a waveform for each note. Notes are in the format @tt{<key>[<octave>][<hold>]}. For example:

@itemlist[
 @item{@racket["C#3--"] is a C-sharp in 3rd octave and held for a total of 3 quarter-notes time;}
 @item{@racket["Bb"] is a B-flat held for a single quarter-note and uses the octave of whatever note preceeded it;}
]

The default octave is 4, but once an octave is specified for a note then that becomes the new default octave for subsequent notes.

How long each note is held for (in seconds) is determined by the @racket[#:tempo] (beats per minute) parameter. A single beat is assumed to be a single quarter-note. So, with a little math, a @tt{"C#--"} at a rate of 160 BPM would play for 1.125 seconds (3 beats * 60 s/m ÷ 160 bpm). It is not possible to specify 1/8th and 1/16th notes. In order to achieve them, increase the @racket[#:tempo] appropriately.

By default, the @racket[voice] used is the @racket[basic-note], which uses the @racket[adsr-envelope] function (ADSR stands for attack, decay, sustain, release). Unlike sounds, which use the envelope function across the entire sound, when generating music the envelope function is applied to each note. This is important to keep in mind if you decide to override the envelope with your own, as it's how each note can be distinguished from the next.
